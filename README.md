# YouTube TimeTags Mobile
Web based time tags (time codes, time stamps, video chapters) editor for YouTube. It is optimized for smartphone browsers. I use it when I need to create YouTube video chapters, but I don't have more power tool (for example the desktop browser with add-on "TimeTags for YouTube").
